# McGameJam-2025
Submission for the 48-hour McGame Jam 2025. The theme for this year was Lost & Found. 

Our team's interpretation was a puzzle game about a famous musician suffering from writer's block and amnesia, as we venture into his mind, he is reminded of his childhood memories which in turn help to recover his memories as well as reignite his creative spark.

The game features 4 minigames depicting 4 of his core childhood memories:
- Accidentally breaking a music box
- Buying his first harp
- Tuning his harp for the first time
- Learning his first song.

The game is additionally complimented with cut scenes throughout to visually assist with the storytelling.
